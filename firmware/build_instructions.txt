This firmware is being developed on a Linux machine using tools from
the Linux repository.  It's currently being developed on Ubuntu 18.04
although the specific Linux version shouldn't really matter.

No IDE is being used here, files are edited using a text editor and
built from the command line.

The build system is based on scons (see scons.org for details).
To install this in a Debian based Linux system like Ubuntu:
   sudo apt install scons

To build the firmware, just enter 
   scons

The compiler I'm using is straight out of the Ubuntu repositories.
It can be installed using the command:

   sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi

I think that will pull in everything needed (assembler, linker, etc)
Please let me know if I've missed anything.

Once the firmware is built, start the board up running the internal 
boot loader and use the bootloader.py script to flash it.

This project contains hardware design (schematics & layout) and firmware design for a
small PCB used to sense air flow and air pressure.  The intent is to use a 3D printed 
Venturi tube with this board to help with the current Covid-19 medical emergency.
The project has two potential uses:

- Part of a larger ventilator project.  The airflow sensor is a key component of a ventilator
  design.

- Stand alone use for sharing a commercial ventilator among multiple patients.
  One problem with sharing a ventilator between patients is equalizing the flow.
  This sensor can be used inline at each patient to allow the emergency workers 
  to regulate flow using flow valves.

Note that I locally maintain my projects using Mercurial (hg) and am pushing to github
using the hg-git plugin.  There may be some odd files in the repo (like .hgignore) due
to that.  These can be ignored.

As of 3/22/20 this project is in the early stages.  A first cut of the PCB has been designed
but no firmware has been started yet.  I'll try to keep this file updated as things progress.
